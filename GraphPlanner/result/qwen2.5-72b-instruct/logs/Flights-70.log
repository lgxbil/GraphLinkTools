2025-07-22 08:02:06,386 - evaluation_logger_Flights-70 - INFO - Query: We're planning to leave Chicago on November 10th, 2024, and travel to Tokyo. After staying in Tokyo for three days, we'll go to Sydney, then return to Chicago on November 24th, 2024. I'm looking for the cheapest business class flights for this time period. If the ticket price is over 1800 dollars, we won't stay in Tokyo. Instead, check the lowest price for a direct round-trip from Chicago to Sydney during this time.
