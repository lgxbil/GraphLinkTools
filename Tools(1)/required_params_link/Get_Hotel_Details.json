The 'checkoutDate' field from the 'Search_Hotels' API response can directly serve as the 'departure_date' parameter for the 'Get_Hotel_Details' API. Both fields share the same data type (Date in yyyy-mm-dd format) and represent the same business concept of a hotel check-out date. This represents a hard dependency as the 'Search_Hotels' API is typically called before 'Get_Hotel_Details' in a standard hotel booking workflow."

The 'departureDate' field from 'Get_Min_Price' matches the 'Date (yyyy-mm-dd)' format required by 'departure_date' in 'Get_Hotel_Details'. However, this represents a soft dependency as the flight API isn't strictly required for hotel details but could provide useful input for travel planning."

The field 'lengthsOfStay[*].date' from the source API matches the 'Date (yyyy-mm-dd)' format required by the target API's 'departure_date' parameter.
