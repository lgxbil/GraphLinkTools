The 'regionName' field from the flight location search can serve as a valid input for the 'query' parameter in the taxi location search, as it represents geographical locations that would be relevant for taxi services. The data type (String) matches perfectly, and the example value 'New York' is exactly the type of location query the taxi API expects."
