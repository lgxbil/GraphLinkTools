From start to finish, it was a humbling and deeply fascinating journey into the heart of Mumbai’s vibrant and resilient communities. Our guide, Abi, was absolutely lovely and made the experience unforgettable. His warmth, knowledge, and passion for sharing the stories of his community were truly inspiring. One of the most touching moments of the tour was when Abi invited us to see his own home and introduced us to his wonderful mum. It was such a personal and genuine gesture that gave us a rare glimpse into the daily lives of the people who live in Mumbai’s slums. Abi’s pride in his community and his openness in sharing his story was incredibly moving. The tour itself was a powerful testament to the resourcefulness, ingenuity, and determination of the vast numbers of people who call Mumbai’s slums home. From the bustling energy of Dharavi—where small-scale industries thrive—to the remarkable efficiency of the Dabbawallas and the mesmerizing sight of Dhobighat, every moment was filled with awe and admiration for the people who make this city what it is. This tour was not just about sightseeing; it was about understanding and appreciating the human spirit. It left us with a profound respect for the resilience and creativity of those who navigate life in such challenging circumstances. We walked away with a new perspective and a deep sense of gratitude. If you’re visiting Mumbai, this tour is an absolute must. Thank you, Abi, for making it such a meaningful and memorable experience. You are a true ambassador for your community, and we feel so lucky to have had the chance to learn from you! ---",

From start to finish, it was a humbling and deeply fascinating journey into the heart of Mumbai’s vibrant and resilient communities. Our guide, Abi, was absolutely lovely and made the experience unforgettable. His warmth, knowledge, and passion for sharing the stories of his community were truly inspiring. One of the most touching moments of the tour was when Abi invited us to see his own home and introduced us to his wonderful mum. It was such a personal and genuine gesture that gave us a rare glimpse into the daily lives of the people who live in Mumbai’s slums. Abi’s pride in his community and his openness in sharing his story was incredibly moving. The tour itself was a powerful testament to the resourcefulness, ingenuity, and determination of the vast numbers of people who call Mumbai’s slums home. From the bustling energy of Dharavi—where small-scale industries thrive—to the remarkable efficiency of the Dabbawallas and the mesmerizing sight of Dhobighat, every moment was filled with awe and admiration for the people who make this city what it is. This tour was not just about sightseeing; it was about understanding and appreciating the human spirit. It left us with a profound respect for the resilience and creativity of those who navigate life in such challenging circumstances. We walked away with a new perspective and a deep sense of gratitude. If you’re visiting Mumbai, this tour is an absolute must. Thank you, Abi, for making it such a meaningful and memorable experience. You are a true ambassador for your community, and we feel so lucky to have had the chance to learn from you! ---",
