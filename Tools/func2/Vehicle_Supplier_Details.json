There was no damage done to this car during my rental, it was impossible as we drove from the airport to our Airbnb and parked in a private driveway with zero other cars. There were many scratches already on the car when I picked it up and no agent documented the condition. They claim I did damage and they previous rental return inspection proves it was me, but they refuse to produce any documents form that inspection.  ",
