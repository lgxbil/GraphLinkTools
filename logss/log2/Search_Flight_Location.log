Your task is to analyze whether response fields from source APIs can serve as valid input parameters for a target API.\n\n#INPUT:\n1. Target API Documentation\n2. Target Parameters Of Target API(One input parameter you need to focus on)\n3. Source API Documentation\n4. List of most likely Source API Resopnse Fields\n\n#RULES:\n1. Carefully read the target API documentation to clearly understand the input parameter requirements of the target API, especially the parameter being focused on.\n2. Analyze the response fields of the source API to determine whether there is a business association with the target API parameter(Soft Dependence) or If it is a necessary prerequisite for calling the target API(Hard Dependence).The departure time of the flight is often related to the car rental drop-off time, while the arrival time of the flight is typically associated with the car rental pick-up time.\n3. Based on the context of the source API's response example, determine which specific field of the source API can be used as input for the target parameters of target api.\n4. Pay attention to whether the data type of the API's response field matches the data type of the target API's parameter.However, sometimes even though the data types do not match exactly, the response field of the source API may contain the information required by the target API parameter. For example, a field with the format \"yyy-mm-dd Hh-Mm\" may include the value needed for the pickUpTime parameter (which expects the format \"24-Hour Hh:Mm\"). In such cases, it is important to carefully examine the example values from the response fields to determine if they can be appropriately adapted or extracted for use as input parameters.\n\n#OUTPUT:\n1. Provide a confidence score between 0-100 for each judgment. If the confidence is below 80, set the dependency relationship to null.\n2. Provide reasons. The reasons should first analyze the meanings of the fields and parameters, determine whether the types match, and consider whether there are reasonable scenarios where the output field of the source API could serve as the input parameter of the target API, paying attention to the causal sequence. If no, reasons are given.\n\n\n#Example:\n\nExample1:\nTarget API Documentation:\n{\n\"name\": \"Car_Search\",\n\"func_description\": \"This API is ideal for travelers seeking car rentals at specific locations and times.

Your task is to analyze whether response fields from source APIs can serve as valid input parameters for a target API.\n\n#INPUT:\n1. Target API Documentation\n2. Target Parameters Of Target API(One input parameter you need to focus on)\n3. Source API Documentation\n4. List of most likely Source API Resopnse Fields\n\n#RULES:\n1. Carefully read the target API documentation to clearly understand the input parameter requirements of the target API, especially the parameter being focused on.\n2. Analyze the response fields of the source API to determine whether there is a business association with the target API parameter(Soft Dependence) or If it is a necessary prerequisite for calling the target API(Hard Dependence).The departure time of the flight is often related to the car rental drop-off time, while the arrival time of the flight is typically associated with the car rental pick-up time.\n3. Based on the context of the source API's response example, determine which specific field of the source API can be used as input for the target parameters of target api.\n4. Pay attention to whether the data type of the API's response field matches the data type of the target API's parameter.However, sometimes even though the data types do not match exactly, the response field of the source API may contain the information required by the target API parameter. For example, a field with the format \"yyy-mm-dd Hh-Mm\" may include the value needed for the pickUpTime parameter (which expects the format \"24-Hour Hh:Mm\"). In such cases, it is important to carefully examine the example values from the response fields to determine if they can be appropriately adapted or extracted for use as input parameters.\n\n#OUTPUT:\n1. Provide a confidence score between 0-100 for each judgment. If the confidence is below 80, set the dependency relationship to null.\n2. Provide reasons. The reasons should first analyze the meanings of the fields and parameters, determine whether the types match, and consider whether there are reasonable scenarios where the output field of the source API could serve as the input parameter of the target API, paying attention to the causal sequence.

:[{"role": "system", "content": "\n#ROLE:\nYou are a professional API Dependency Evaluator. Your task is to analyze whether response fields from source APIs can serve as valid input parameters for a target API.\n\n#INPUT:\n1. Target API Documentation\n2. Target Parameters Of Target API(One input parameter you need to focus on)\n3. Source API Documentation\n4. List of most likely Source API Resopnse Fields\n\n#RULES:\n1. Carefully read the target API documentation to clearly understand the input parameter requirements of the target API, especially the parameter being focused on.\n2. Analyze the response fields of the source API to determine whether there is a business association with the target API parameter(Soft Dependence) or If it is a necessary prerequisite for calling the target API(Hard Dependence).The departure time of the flight is often related to the car rental drop-off time, while the arrival time of the flight is typically associated with the car rental pick-up time.\n3. Based on the context of the source API's response example, determine which specific field of the source API can be used as input for the target parameters of target api.\n4. Pay attention to whether the data type of the API's response field matches the data type of the target API's parameter.However, sometimes even though the data types do not match exactly, the response field of the source API may contain the information required by the target API parameter. For example, a field with the format \"yyy-mm-dd Hh-Mm\" may include the value needed for the pickUpTime parameter (which expects the format \"24-Hour Hh:Mm\"). In such cases, it is important to carefully examine the example values from the response fields to determine if they can be appropriately adapted or extracted for use as input parameters.\n\n#OUTPUT:\n1. Provide a confidence score between 0-100 for each judgment. If the confidence is below 80, set the dependency relationship to null.\n2. Provide reasons. The reasons should first analyze the meanings of the fields and parameters, determine whether the types match, and consider whether there are reasonable scenarios where the output field of the source API could serve as the input parameter of the target API, paying attention to the causal sequence. If no, reasons are given.\n\n\n#Example:\n\nExample1:\nTarget API Documentation:\n{\n\"name\": \"Car_Search\",\n\"func_description\": \"This API is ideal for travelers seeking car rentals at specific locations and times.

Your task is to analyze whether response fields from source APIs can serve as valid input parameters for a target API.\n\n#INPUT:\n1. Target API Documentation\n2. Target Parameters Of Target API(One input parameter you need to focus on)\n3. Source API Documentation\n4. List of most likely Source API Resopnse Fields\n\n#RULES:\n1. Carefully read the target API documentation to clearly understand the input parameter requirements of the target API, especially the parameter being focused on.\n2. Analyze the response fields of the source API to determine whether there is a business association with the target API parameter(Soft Dependence) or If it is a necessary prerequisite for calling the target API(Hard Dependence).The departure time of the flight is often related to the car rental drop-off time, while the arrival time of the flight is typically associated with the car rental pick-up time.\n3. Based on the context of the source API's response example, determine which specific field of the source API can be used as input for the target parameters of target api.\n4. Pay attention to whether the data type of the API's response field matches the data type of the target API's parameter.However, sometimes even though the data types do not match exactly, the response field of the source API may contain the information required by the target API parameter. For example, a field with the format \"yyy-mm-dd Hh-Mm\" may include the value needed for the pickUpTime parameter (which expects the format \"24-Hour Hh:Mm\"). In such cases, it is important to carefully examine the example values from the response fields to determine if they can be appropriately adapted or extracted for use as input parameters.\n\n#OUTPUT:\n1. Provide a confidence score between 0-100 for each judgment. If the confidence is below 80, set the dependency relationship to null.\n2. Provide reasons. The reasons should first analyze the meanings of the fields and parameters, determine whether the types match, and consider whether there are reasonable scenarios where the output field of the source API could serve as the input parameter of the target API, paying attention to the causal sequence. If no, reasons are given.\n\n\n#Example:\n\nExample1:\nTarget API Documentation:\n{\n\"name\": \"Car_Search\",\n\"func_description\": \"This API is ideal for travelers seeking car rentals at specific locations and times.

Your task is to analyze whether response fields from source APIs can serve as valid input parameters for a target API.\n\n#INPUT:\n1. Target API Documentation\n2. Target Parameters Of Target API(One input parameter you need to focus on)\n3. Source API Documentation\n4. List of most likely Source API Resopnse Fields\n\n#RULES:\n1. Carefully read the target API documentation to clearly understand the input parameter requirements of the target API, especially the parameter being focused on.\n2. Analyze the response fields of the source API to determine whether there is a business association with the target API parameter(Soft Dependence) or If it is a necessary prerequisite for calling the target API(Hard Dependence).The departure time of the flight is often related to the car rental drop-off time, while the arrival time of the flight is typically associated with the car rental pick-up time.\n3. Based on the context of the source API's response example, determine which specific field of the source API can be used as input for the target parameters of target api.\n4. Pay attention to whether the data type of the API's response field matches the data type of the target API's parameter.However, sometimes even though the data types do not match exactly, the response field of the source API may contain the information required by the target API parameter. For example, a field with the format \"yyy-mm-dd Hh-Mm\" may include the value needed for the pickUpTime parameter (which expects the format \"24-Hour Hh:Mm\"). In such cases, it is important to carefully examine the example values from the response fields to determine if they can be appropriately adapted or extracted for use as input parameters.\n\n#OUTPUT:\n1. Provide a confidence score between 0-100 for each judgment. If the confidence is below 80, set the dependency relationship to null.\n2. Provide reasons. The reasons should first analyze the meanings of the fields and parameters, determine whether the types match, and consider whether there are reasonable scenarios where the output field of the source API could serve as the input parameter of the target API, paying attention to the causal sequence. If no, reasons are given.\n\n\n#Example:\n\nExample1:\nTarget API Documentation:\n{\n\"name\": \"Car_Search\",\n\"func_description\": \"This API is ideal for travelers seeking car rentals at specific locations and times.

Your task is to analyze whether response fields from source APIs can serve as valid input parameters for a target API.\n\n#INPUT:\n1. Target API Documentation\n2. Target Parameters Of Target API(One input parameter you need to focus on)\n3. Source API Documentation\n4. List of most likely Source API Resopnse Fields\n\n#RULES:\n1. Carefully read the target API documentation to clearly understand the input parameter requirements of the target API, especially the parameter being focused on.\n2. Analyze the response fields of the source API to determine whether there is a business association with the target API parameter(Soft Dependence) or If it is a necessary prerequisite for calling the target API(Hard Dependence).The departure time of the flight is often related to the car rental drop-off time, while the arrival time of the flight is typically associated with the car rental pick-up time.\n3. Based on the context of the source API's response example, determine which specific field of the source API can be used as input for the target parameters of target api.\n4. Pay attention to whether the data type of the API's response field matches the data type of the target API's parameter.However, sometimes even though the data types do not match exactly, the response field of the source API may contain the information required by the target API parameter. For example, a field with the format \"yyy-mm-dd Hh-Mm\" may include the value needed for the pickUpTime parameter (which expects the format \"24-Hour Hh:Mm\"). In such cases, it is important to carefully examine the example values from the response fields to determine if they can be appropriately adapted or extracted for use as input parameters.\n\n#OUTPUT:\n1. Provide a confidence score between 0-100 for each judgment. If the confidence is below 80, set the dependency relationship to null.\n2. Provide reasons. The reasons should first analyze the meanings of the fields and parameters, determine whether the types match, and consider whether there are reasonable scenarios where the output field of the source API could serve as the input parameter of the target API, paying attention to the causal sequence.

Pay attention to whether the data type of the API's response field matches the data type of the target API's parameter.However, sometimes even though the data types do not match exactly, the response field of the source API may contain the information required by the target API parameter. For example, a field with the format \"yyy-mm-dd Hh-Mm\" may include the value needed for the pickUpTime parameter (which expects the format \"24-Hour Hh:Mm\"). In such cases, it is important to carefully examine the example values from the response fields to determine if they can be appropriately adapted or extracted for use as input parameters.\n\n#OUTPUT:\n1. Provide a confidence score between 0-100 for each judgment. If the confidence is below 80, set the dependency relationship to null.\n2. Provide reasons. The reasons should first analyze the meanings of the fields and parameters, determine whether the types match, and consider whether there are reasonable scenarios where the output field of the source API could serve as the input parameter of the target API, paying attention to the causal sequence. If no, reasons are given.\n\n\n#Example:\n\nExample1:\nTarget API Documentation:\n{\n\"name\": \"Car_Search\",\n\"func_description\": \"This API is ideal for travelers seeking car rentals at specific locations and times.

Your task is to analyze whether response fields from source APIs can serve as valid input parameters for a target API.\n\n#INPUT:\n1. Target API Documentation\n2. Target Parameters Of Target API(One input parameter you need to focus on)\n3. Source API Documentation\n4. List of most likely Source API Resopnse Fields\n\n#RULES:\n1. Carefully read the target API documentation to clearly understand the input parameter requirements of the target API, especially the parameter being focused on.\n2. Analyze the response fields of the source API to determine whether there is a business association with the target API parameter(Soft Dependence) or If it is a necessary prerequisite for calling the target API(Hard Dependence).The departure time of the flight is often related to the car rental drop-off time, while the arrival time of the flight is typically associated with the car rental pick-up time.\n3. Based on the context of the source API's response example, determine which specific field of the source API can be used as input for the target parameters of target api.\n4. Pay attention to whether the data type of the API's response field matches the data type of the target API's parameter.However, sometimes even though the data types do not match exactly, the response field of the source API may contain the information required by the target API parameter. For example, a field with the format \"yyy-mm-dd Hh-Mm\" may include the value needed for the pickUpTime parameter (which expects the format \"24-Hour Hh:Mm\"). In such cases, it is important to carefully examine the example values from the response fields to determine if they can be appropriately adapted or extracted for use as input parameters.\n\n#OUTPUT:\n1. Provide a confidence score between 0-100 for each judgment. If the confidence is below 80, set the dependency relationship to null.\n2. Provide reasons. The reasons should first analyze the meanings of the fields and parameters, determine whether the types match, and consider whether there are reasonable scenarios where the output field of the source API could serve as the input parameter of the target API, paying attention to the causal sequence.

Analyze the response fields of the source API to determine whether there is a business association with the target API parameter(Soft Dependence) or If it is a necessary prerequisite for calling the target API(Hard Dependence).The departure time of the flight is often related to the car rental drop-off time, while the arrival time of the flight is typically associated with the car rental pick-up time.\n3. Based on the context of the source API's response example, determine which specific field of the source API can be used as input for the target parameters of target api.\n4. Pay attention to whether the data type of the API's response field matches the data type of the target API's parameter.However, sometimes even though the data types do not match exactly, the response field of the source API may contain the information required by the target API parameter. For example, a field with the format \"yyy-mm-dd Hh-Mm\" may include the value needed for the pickUpTime parameter (which expects the format \"24-Hour Hh:Mm\"). In such cases, it is important to carefully examine the example values from the response fields to determine if they can be appropriately adapted or extracted for use as input parameters.\n\n#OUTPUT:\n1. Provide a confidence score between 0-100 for each judgment. If the confidence is below 80, set the dependency relationship to null.\n2. Provide reasons. The reasons should first analyze the meanings of the fields and parameters, determine whether the types match, and consider whether there are reasonable scenarios where the output field of the source API could serve as the input parameter of the target API, paying attention to the causal sequence. If no, reasons are given.\n\n\n#Example:\n\nExample1:\nTarget API Documentation:\n{\n\"name\": \"Car_Search\",\n\"func_description\": \"This API is ideal for travelers seeking car rentals at specific locations and times.

Your task is to analyze whether response fields from source APIs can serve as valid input parameters for a target API.\n\n#INPUT:\n1. Target API Documentation\n2. Target Parameters Of Target API(One input parameter you need to focus on)\n3. Source API Documentation\n4. List of most likely Source API Resopnse Fields\n\n#RULES:\n1. Carefully read the target API documentation to clearly understand the input parameter requirements of the target API, especially the parameter being focused on.\n2. Analyze the response fields of the source API to determine whether there is a business association with the target API parameter(Soft Dependence) or If it is a necessary prerequisite for calling the target API(Hard Dependence).The departure time of the flight is often related to the car rental drop-off time, while the arrival time of the flight is typically associated with the car rental pick-up time.\n3. Based on the context of the source API's response example, determine which specific field of the source API can be used as input for the target parameters of target api.\n4. Pay attention to whether the data type of the API's response field matches the data type of the target API's parameter.However, sometimes even though the data types do not match exactly, the response field of the source API may contain the information required by the target API parameter. For example, a field with the format \"yyy-mm-dd Hh-Mm\" may include the value needed for the pickUpTime parameter (which expects the format \"24-Hour Hh:Mm\"). In such cases, it is important to carefully examine the example values from the response fields to determine if they can be appropriately adapted or extracted for use as input parameters.\n\n#OUTPUT:\n1. Provide a confidence score between 0-100 for each judgment. If the confidence is below 80, set the dependency relationship to null.\n2. Provide reasons. The reasons should first analyze the meanings of the fields and parameters, determine whether the types match, and consider whether there are reasonable scenarios where the output field of the source API could serve as the input parameter of the target API, paying attention to the causal sequence. If no, reasons are given.\n\n\n#Example:\n\nExample1:\nTarget API Documentation:\n{\n\"name\": \"Car_Search\",\n\"func_description\": \"This API is ideal for travelers seeking car rentals at specific locations and times.
